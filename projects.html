            <p class="modal-description">
                This project was done at USC with a team of five group members. We were tasked with 
                building an Android chat pet app. The part that I was in charge with was most of the 
                backend, creating the database for the app, and creating all the API routes. I used 
                SpringBoot for the backend setup and coded in JavaScript for all of the backend code. 
                I used SQL to create the database.

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p class="modal-description">
                This project was during my internship as an A.I. Researcher under Professor Jonathan Gratch 
                at University of Southern California. During this internship, I was given a large dataset of
                buyers and sellers from different countries. Besides data about where the buyer/seller was from
                and the dialog between them, there were other variables such as education levels, risk aversion score, 
                gender, and more. 
            </p>

            <h3>Using Embedded Classification</h3>
            <pre class="code-block code-block-python">
                <code class="language-python">
# Compute confusion matrix
cf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred, labels=labels)

# Create flattened counts and percentages
group_counts = ["{0:0.0f}".format(value) for value in cf_matrix.flatten()]
group_percentages = ["{0:.1%}".format(value) for value in cf_matrix.flatten()/np.sum(cf_matrix)]
group_labels = [f"{v1}\n{v2}" for v1, v2 in zip(group_counts, group_percentages)]
group_labels = np.asarray(group_labels).reshape(len(labels), len(labels))

# Plot heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cf_matrix, annot=group_labels, fmt='', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=labels, yticklabels=labels)
plt.ylabel("True")
plt.xlabel("Predicted")
plt.title("Confusion Matrix")
plt.show()
                </code>
            </pre>

            <p class="modal-description">
                One of my first tasks was to pull 80 pairs of buyers and sellers who were from the same 
                country. Then I would do embedded classification on them using the OpenAI API. I would
                share these results by creating a confusion matrix to show my professor. Additionally, 
                from those results, I also had to do an analysis on why the AI made mistakes on some of 
                the predictions and form a pattern. 
            </p>
            <p class="modal-description">
                During the first phase of my research, I refined my code to do both logistic and linear 
                regression to analyze the predicted results with different variables (buyer/seller education
                levels, risk aversion score, etc.). For the logistic regression analyses, I would use confusion
                matrices to show the results and for the linear regression analyses I would use plot graphs. 
            </p>

            <h3>Testing with Other Models</h3>
            <p class="modal-description">
                During the second phase of my research, I made the same analyses using different models. I created
                Python scripts using SVM and Random Forest models that tested the same predictions as before. With 
                these results, my professor was able to compare how each of the models performed.

                The part that I was in charge of was creating the database for the website and the 
                backend code for the user. I also took charge in creating some of the API routes 
                and some of the frontend logic (i.e. transferring ownership of projects, adjusting API 
                connections, etc.). I also helped fix various backend issues within the backend team.
            </p>

            <h3>Creating the Database</h3>

            <p class="modal-description">
                The above diagram shows the database I designed for this project. Since each user could be 
                a member of or own various projects and be in charge of several tasks, we had many one-to-many
                and many-to-many relationships. 
            </p>

            <h3>Backend for the User</h3>
            <pre class="code-block code-block-javascript">
                <code class="language-javascript">
@JsonIgnore
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL) 
private List<Availability> availability = new ArrayList<>(); 

@JsonIgnore
@OneToMany(mappedBy = "user", cascade = CascadeType.ALL)
private List<ProjectMember> memberships = new ArrayList<>(); 
	
public User(int userID, String username, String email, boolean isGuest) {
	this.userID = userID; 
	this.username = username; 
	this.email = email; 
	this.isGuest = isGuest;

            <p class="modal-description">
                The above code shows the part of the User model where I created the 
                relationships for the user.

            <h3>Transferring Ownership</h3>
            <img src="images/CSCI201_ownership.png" alt="CSCI201_ownership" class="modal-image">
            <p class="modal-description">
                Transferring ownership of a project was one of the many important features that 
                were implemented for this project. For this part, I took charge within the 
                frontend team. This gave me the opportunity to learn React which I was not familiar 
                with at first but quickly got the grasp of.
