                    <p>
                        Hello! My name is Danah Yun (pronounced as Donna) and I'm from 
                        Aberdeen, Washington. I'm a current senior at USC studying computer
                        science. I have a strong focus on backend systems, APIs, and data-driven 
                        applications. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>My Values in Coding</h3>
                    <p>
                        When building, I tend to care a lot about cohesiveness from the dataset design 
                        to the code structure and style. While I enjoy working with frontend components, most of 
                        my experience and strength lies in backend development, where I can focus on designing 
                        reliable systems and solving underlying logic problems. 
                    </p>

                    <h3>Collaboration & Teamwork</h3>
                    <p>
                        Across my internship, coursework, and group project experiences, what I value most is 
                        collaborative work. I often take on leadership roles and act as a bridge between team 
                        members, especially between frontend and backend. I've learned that projects are most 
                        successful when both sides understand each others' constraints and work toward a shared
                        structure and goal. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h3>Current Project</h3>
                    <p>
                        My current project is making a social media website for young developers where they can 
                        post about their projects, experiences, and growth as developers. The platform is mean 
                        to help users connect with others who have similar interests, skills, and project ideas. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, I'm building a personal diary feature that allows users to log their coding 
                        journey over time, encouragingg reflection and long-term growth.
